  Management advice:
         Resizing this file may improve performance
    for access to the file.   This conclusion was reached
    for the following reasons:

       - File is in level two overflow.

       - Too many level one overflow or free blocks.

       - File is mostly empty and wasting disk space.

       - The average number of records per group is
         greater than 20.

       The average data size of 116.12 bytes,
    the standard deviation of 679.35 bytes,
    and the total data size of 323614 bytes
    were evaluated.  The predicted resize
    block size is 8192 bytes.  The predicted
    resize modulo is 73 group(s).
    The current block size is 1024 bytes.
    The current modulo is 23 group(s).
