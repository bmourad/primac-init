* BY          - rick; CBA
* DATE        - 10/1/96
* DESCRIPTION -
*  this subroutine will handle matread and locking as a generic subroutine
*  also associated with this routine is an init cpylib stored in 
*  the CPYLIB file DOMATREADU_INIT.   In preparation to call DOMATREADU
*  it expects that 6 variable will be set up prior to it being referenced,
*  the DOMATREADU_INIT is setup and the SYSCOM pgm is initialized
*
*  MAT READ_REC - mat array of dim 500 that contains the record to be read
*  DOREAD_FILEVAR - the filevar of the file to read result of the open stmt
*  DOREAD_FILENAME - string representation of the file being read
*  DOREAD_ID - id of the record to be read
*  DOREAD_WAITSTATE - flag for the locked clause indicating what to do
*                     0-wait without option to quit, 1-wait with option to
*                     quit  default = 0
*  DOREAD_WAITTIME - number of seconds between wait cycles - default = 15
